# Credit-Card-Fraud-Neural-Network
This is a neural network to find Credit Card fraud, made using a training set from Kaagle, found here: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhanushnarayananr/credit-card-fraud?resource=download)

In this repository, there is a jupyter notebook called Credit Card Fraud, which can make and save the model. However, the training data must first be downloaded and can be found in the link to Kaagle.

I have also attached my own model made from this notebook, called ccf_model_one.keras. It has an accuracy of 99.63%.

This graph shows the total loss over ten iterations for the model I have included. The notebook also contains a block of code to make this graph.
