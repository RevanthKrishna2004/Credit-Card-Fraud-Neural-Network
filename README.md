# Credit-Card-Fraud-Neural-Network
This is a neural network to find Credit Card fraud, made using a training set from Kaagle, found here: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhanushnarayananr/credit-card-fraud?resource=download)

The tools used in this notebook include: TensorFlow, Keras, Sklearn, Matplotlib, and Numpy

This repository has a jupyter notebook called Credit Card Fraud, which can make and save the model. However, the training data must first be downloaded and can be found in the link to Kaagle.

The training data has 8 features, distance_from_home, distance_from_last_transaction, ratio_to_median_purchase_price, repeat_retailer	used_chip, used_pin_number, online_order, and fraud.

I have also attached my own model made from this notebook, called ccf_model_one.keras. It has an accuracy of 99.63%.

This graph shows the total loss over ten training iterations for the model I have included. The notebook also contains a block of code to make this graph.
